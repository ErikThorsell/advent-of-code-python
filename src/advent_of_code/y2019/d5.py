    Day 5 part 1 uses the load() operation several times before ultimately terminating on opcode 99.
    Day 7 requires that one loops several times and return on both opcode 99 and opcode 4 (load).
    Since I ultimately want _all_ days to work, I went back and modified Day 5 s.t. I could use the same Intcode class
    for both days.

    Day 5 part 2 does not have the same problem.

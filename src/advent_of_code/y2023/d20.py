    """Some explanation is in order.
    
    By inspecting the input file we can see what is required in order to turn on rx.
    In the case of my input, this is: &lb -> rx, meaning that rx will turn on when lb
    sends a low pulse.

    We can learn when &lb will send a low pulse by inspecting its preceding modules.
    In the case of my input, these are: &rz, &lf, &br, &fk.
    By looking at the iteration number every time the input is one of the above
    modules, it is possible to deduce that the behaviour of these modules are
    cyclic. 

    By "pressing the button" until every module of interest has appeared twice, it
    is possible to find the least common multiple for all four cycles.
    The cycle for a module is simply the difference between the two iteration numbers
    where the module was an input.
